**Game Name:** 
Gone Fishing \n
**Intent:** 
Create a game revolving arounf the topic "Fish", while providing a clean and relaxing or competitive experince for the player.
**Narritive Structure:** 
The narritive is left up to the player therough the gameplay of being a fisherman trying to catch as many fish as possible.
**Mechanics:** 
User input is derived from mouse inputs. The hook will follow the players mouse until they decide to leftclick, this action will cause the hook to decend, but the player may not move the hook on the x axis while decending, similar to that of an arcade claw machine. The hook will hook fish it comes into contact with an reel them in once reeled in the score will increase. If timed right the player can hook multiple fish on one pull.
**Aesthetics:** 
When designing the game we tried to provide a combination of bright and soothing colors, along side a cartoon like art style. We also made the decision to add background music and other sound effects to help keep the player engaged.
**Joys:** 
Overall this project provided a fun introductory experience to the unity engine as it almost felt like putting a puzzle together to create a neat and enjoyable final product. The usage of sprites and sounds was definitly enjoyable as they allowed the project to come to life.
**Struggles:** 
The project in general wasn't exacly the most difficult, but certain tasks were somewhat challenging, one in particular was getting the fish and hook to cooperate when reeling the fish in. Another challenge was trying to get a good balance in the spawn rate of the diffrent fish.
